# About

**Under Construction**

This project is the frontend for [mphotos](https://www.github.com/msvens/photos).

It is my personal [photo blog](https://www.mellowtech.org). The focus is to create
a simplified workflow from lightroom to photo blog such that once you export
your edited images to Google Drive they will be automatically picked up by the
photo blog.

## Key Features

- Connect to google drive
- Automatic exif parsing and thumbnail creation
- Setting basic user profile information
- Create, delete and edit image information
- Private photos - set photos to only be viewable if you are logged in
- Add photos to albums

# TODO
- Infinite Scrolling of Image Grid
- Customizable UI
    - compact view (make more space for images)
    - columns in image grid
    - space between images in image grid
    - what image information to display and how
- Swipable image list
- Smarter image sizing depending on landscape, portrait mode
- Comments, Likes
- Tablet/Mobile enhancements

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The excellent [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) serves as the UI framework
